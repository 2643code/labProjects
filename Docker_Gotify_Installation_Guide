Docker Lab Documentation 

I tried installing through the terminal and got this output when I tested it. I realized I was actually following instructions for installing Docker Engine, rather than Docker Desktop. 

 

To be safe, I deleted it and downloaded Docker Desktop Installer.exe from this website. (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#uninstall-old-versions).  

I set up the apt repository using the following commands: 

sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings 

sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc 

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc 

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources <<EOF 
Types: deb 
URIs: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu 
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") 
Components: stable 
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc 
EOF 

sudo apt update 

Since the VM did not have an installer app to use, I used the terminal to install Docker. I used the command “sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin" to download the docker compose files.  

Then, I checked if it was working with “sudo systemctl status docker” and received this output. As you can see, the docker is enabled and active. 

I chose to download Gotify and used the “sudo docker pull gotify/server” to get the image from the server. 

Then, I created the yml file with the cat command and the specifications in the picture. 

 

 

This is another view of the yml configuration file. 

 

Next, test that Gotify is working by going to a browser and searching “localhost” (the http is automatically prepended). When the site loads, the default username and password are both “admin”. 

Upon logging in, you can verify that Gotify is up and running on the docker. Yay!
