I tried installing through the terminal and got this output when I tested it. I realized I was actually following instructions for installing Docker Engine, rather than Docker Desktop. 

 

To be safe, I deleted it and downloaded Docker Desktop Installer.exe from this website. (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#uninstall-old-versions).  

I set up the apt repository using the following commands: 

sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings 

installs the keyrings for the repository 

sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc 

visits the https website for downloading docker 

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc 

chmod changes file or directory permissions 

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources <<EOF 
Types: deb 
URIs: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu 
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") 
Components: stable 
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc 
EOF 

writes a file by reading the input and sending it to the file. <<EOF  indicates that the string “EOF” input will end the input reading and save the file 

sudo apt update 

updates the system to refresh the repositories for the later steps 

*Using sudo on all of these commands allows root permissions 

Since the VM did not have an installer app to use, I used the terminal to install Docker. I used the command “sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin" to download the docker compose files. It is the regular sudo apt install (package) format, but lists many packages consecutively to download multiple. 

Then, I checked if it was working with “sudo systemctl status docker” and received this output. As you can see, the docker is enabled and active. The systemctl command is often used for enabling programs or checking their status.  

I chose to download Gotify and used the “sudo docker pull gotify/server” to get the image from the server. 

Then, I created the yml file with the cat command and the specifications in the picture. Similar to the earlier tee command, cat writes the input to a file. Yet, this one will concatenate the input, writing it at the end of the file. 

 

 

This is another view of the yml configuration file. 

 

Next, test that Gotify is working by going to a browser and searching “localhost” (the http is automatically prepended). When the site loads, the default username and password are both “admin”. 

Upon logging in, you can verify that Gotify is up and running on the docker. Yay!
